  execution of maxmath.py - 

  We need to pass the dictionary file as an argument and take input of the sentence from stdin, the 1st line is the stdin and the 2nd line is the result that we received from the

   To check the performance, word error rate is calculated by passing the hypothesis and reference files, hypothesis file is generated from the maxmatch.py code and reference file has 
   the original sentence with space as token separator. The WER comes out to be 30.30% for the 1st sentence.
